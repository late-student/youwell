Over the course of my life, I have personally experienced—and closely witnessed—the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy habits. In addition, I have been a nurse for more than 20 years, and throughout my career I have seen firsthand that true health and wellness require dedication, consistency, and mindful action.</p><p data-start="562" data-end="922">As a single parent and a nurse, I have faced many challenges and inevitable stressors. These experiences taught me that if I wanted to preserve my physical and mental well-being—and truly be present for others—I first had to learn how to care for myself with compassion and intention. This became a journey of self-awareness, self-respect, and personal growth.</p><p data-start="924" data-end="1226">I strongly believe that the mind and body have a remarkable capacity to heal, restore, and function at their optimal level when we give them the opportunity to do so through healthy habits. When we commit to caring for ourselves, our spirit can remain strong regardless of what we have endured in life.</p><p data-start="1228" data-end="1822">From the heart, and inspired by a deep desire to support your well-being, I created these charts to help you actively track and nurture your health and wellness. They are designed to encourage positive habits, improve quality of life, and empower you to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible. While aging brings its own challenges, many of the healthiest and most vibrant elders I have known discovered that they had far more control over their quality of life than they ever imagined. They chose to listen to their bodies, take action, and honor the gift of life they were given.</p><p data-start="1228" data-end="1822"><strong>-Neri</strong></p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li class="active"><a href="https://youwell.live/about-creator.html" class="al" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://youwell.live/you-well-system-sample.html" class="al" target="_self">Demo</a></li><li><a href="https://youwell.live/purchase.html" class="al" target="_self">Purchase</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright You,Well LLC 2026</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://youwell.live/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://youwell.live/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
